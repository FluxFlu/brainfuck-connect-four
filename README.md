# brainfuck-connect-four
About two years ago I wrote this connect four program in brainfuck using a javascript interpreter. Found it in my old files and decided to post.

Use the left and right arrow keys to move, and the down arrow key to drop. Usually takes a few presses because of how laggy it is.

Doesn't have win checking and I won't ever add it.
